# 📡 Radar Sensors in ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)

## 🧠 Overview
**Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging)** is one of the core sensing technologies used in **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.  
It detects the **distance, speed, and direction** of surrounding objects by emitting radio waves and analyzing their reflections.

Radar plays a crucial role in enabling safety features like:
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Forward Collision Warning (FCW)
- Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
- Blind Spot Detection (BSD)
- Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)

## ⚙️ How Radar Works
1. **Transmission:** Radar sensor emits continuous or pulsed radio frequency (RF) waves.  
2. **Reflection:** Waves bounce back from nearby objects.  
3. **Reception & Processing:**  
   - **Time delay (Δt):** calculates distance.  
   - **Frequency shift (Doppler effect):** measures speed.  
   - **Angle of reflection:** determines object position.  
4. **Output Data:**  
   - Distance (range)  
   - Velocity (speed)  
   - Azimuth angle (direction)
